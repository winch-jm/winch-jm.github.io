<!-- Hi, my name is Jeff and this is my personal website. I studied math and computer science at Drexel University and now I do machine learning applied to stem-cell-based pathology research. 

At NYSCF, I split my time between building automated QC tools for large-scale, cell assay pipelines and uncovering cell-level phenotypes of disease via computer vision.

My current research interests are multi-modal data integration, representation learning, and interpretable AI.

Hi, I'm Jeff, a dedicated professional with a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, honed during my academic journey at Drexel University. My passion for technology and its application to cutting-edge research has led me to a career focused on machine learning within the realm of stem-cell-based pathology.

At NYSCF, I fulfill a dual role. I am actively engaged in the development of sophisticated quality control tools for large-scale cell assay pipelines, ensuring the precision and reliability of vital experiments. Simultaneously, I leverage advanced computer vision techniques to unearth valuable insights at the cellular level, contributing significantly to the understanding of diseases.

My research pursuits are deeply rooted in multi-modal data integration, where I explore innovative methods to harmonize disparate data sources for a more comprehensive perspective. Furthermore, my expertise in representation learning enables me to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets. A key tenet of my work is the pursuit of interpretable AI, ensuring that the models I develop not only yield accurate results but also provide insights that can be understood and applied by researchers and medical professionals.

I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of machine learning in the field of stem-cell-based pathology research, and I am always eager to collaborate on projects that share my passion for innovation, precision, and impact. -->

Hi, I’m Jeff Winchell, a data scientist with a background in mathematics and computer science. I currently work at the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) in New York City, where I use machine learning and statistical techniques to help drive discoveries in drug development and stem cell research. With over two years of experience in data science, I’ve worked on everything from image analysis to deep learning tools for biological research.

I graduated from Drexel University in 2021 with dual bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. During my time there, I worked on several research projects involving machine learning, image processing, and optimization, which sparked my interest in computational biology and data science. Since then, I’ve been passionate about using data to solve complex problems in the life sciences.

When I’m not working on data projects, I enjoy mentoring others, presenting research at conferences, and continuously expanding my knowledge in applied mathematics and machine learning.
