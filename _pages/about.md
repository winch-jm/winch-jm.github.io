Hi, my name is Jeff and this is my personal website. I studied math and computer science at Drexel University and now I do machine learning applied to stem-cell-based pathology research. 

At NYSCF, I split my time between building automated QC tools for large-scale, cell assay pipelines and uncovering cell-level phenotypes of disease via computer vision.

My current research interests are multi-modal data integration, representation learning, and interpretable AI.
